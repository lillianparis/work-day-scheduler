## Description
This calender application will feature HTML and Css powered by jQuery. When 
you open the planner, the current workday should be displayed at the top
of the calender. As you scroll down you will be presented with timeblocks
for your typical buissiness hours. The timeblocks will be color coded to
indicate whether the task is in the past present or future, to make the layout 
more organized. If you click on a timeblock you can enter an event and once
you press save the timeblock will save what you've entered. The text is 
saved in local storage and if you refreash the page, the saved events will
still exist. This application will help its users manage their time more effectively,
alongside the demands of a busy life.
